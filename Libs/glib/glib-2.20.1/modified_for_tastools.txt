This package was modified for tastools from the official glib-2.20.1 release because I wasnt sure how else to get it running.
search for //desmume: for differences, though, since that is where this was first used.

Additionally, the entire build process was altered, to fit with the methodology in this libraries depot
Hopefully we'll never have to upgrade this package.
