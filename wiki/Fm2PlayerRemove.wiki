Introduction

This file is a utility specifically for [http://fceux.com/web/FM2.html FM2] files.  These files are text based and if a user has fourscore enabled by accident, they can end up with 2 controllers worth of useless data.  This program is intended to strip away the unneeded controller info and fix the necessary header flags resulting in a much smaller and tidy input file.

It must be fed the filename through commandline.  Windows users can simply drop the input file on the .exe.

It will output a fixed .fm2 file in the same directory as the existing.
