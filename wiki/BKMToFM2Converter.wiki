This program converts movies from .BKM (Movie version v0.0.1) to .FM2 (Movie version 3). To use it, you can invoke it from the command line with 0-2 parameters. If you provide no parameters, it will prompt you for the input and output file from standard input. If you provide 1, it will derive the output filename from the provided input filename. If you provide 2, it will use the first as the input filename and the second as the output filename.
