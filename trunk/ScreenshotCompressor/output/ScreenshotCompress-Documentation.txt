ScreenshotCompress.exe

This program is designed to compress a .png file optimally using pngout.exe and deflopt.exe.  (You will need those programs for this to work).
It is intended to be used with 2D video game screenshots.
It runs a configurable amount (see ScreenshotCompress.cfg; default 100) of random trials and chooses the lowest file size.

ScreenshotCompress.exe, ScreenshotCompress.cfg, pngout.exe, and deflopt.exe  must all be in the same directory.


__Using__

There are several says to compress the file using this program.

1) Drag and drop

This is the main intention of this program.  Simply drag and drop your .png file onto ScreenshotCompress.exe and it will do the rest.
The file will be replaced with a compressed version.
The file can contain spaces, and does not need to be the same directory as ScreenshotCompress

2) Double click ScreenshotCompress.exe

If you double click the program, no filename is specified and it will default to test.png in the same folder.
If there is a test.png in the folder it will compress it, else it will error.

3) Specify a filename through commandline or a batch file

This will work the same as drag and drop.
