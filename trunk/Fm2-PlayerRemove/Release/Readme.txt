Fm2-PlayerRemove

If you recorded a 1 or 2 player movie but had fourscore enabled, you have a movie with 4 controller inputs recorded instead of 2.  With text based movies this can bloat the filesize considerably.  This program strips the extra controllers and fixes relevant movie flags.

To run it must receive the filename through command line.  Windows users - drag & drop the file onto the .exe file.
