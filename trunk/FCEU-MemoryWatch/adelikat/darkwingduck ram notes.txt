				-to be continued-
$043x	weird counter.. counts from 0 to 5 (?); stops when darkwing duck ducks
$044x	actual y-pos on screen ($00FA holds scrolling pos.. this value is set by substracting $00FA from normal y-pos, l. PC:$803D)
$045x	actual x-pos on screen ($00FC holds scrolling pos.. this value is set by substracting $00FC from normal x-pos, l. PC:$804D)
$047x	sub-x-pos
$048x	counter; if sprite is a drop it will vanish when this value reaches 0
$04Dx	(?) sprite state flag - e.g. $81 triggers the initial animation of the turtle enemy found in Quackerjack's level, $80 freezes it; anything below $80 (>=0, BPL) will result in death
$04Ex	(?) affects sprite behavior (e.g. $02 -> heavy gas)
$04Fx	x-pos [l]
$050x	x-pos [h]
$051x	y-pos [l]
$052x	y-pos [h]
$053x	sub-walking-speed
$054x	walking-speed
$055x	sub-y-pos
$056x	y-speed
$057x	collision type flag (?)
			none (00): none: no collision occurs (no damage)
			bit0 (01): insensitive: collision occurs when dw walks further into the sprite
			bit1 (02): sensitive: collision occurs as soon as one pixel is touched
			bit2 (08): less sensitive: same as bit1, but more sensitive
			bit6 (40): can be shot by dw
			bit7 (80): ejects dw upwards when hit (+solid)
$058x	enemy walk dir (1=right,2=left); may stop at waypoints(?), may jump over obstacles (hey, they've got brains!)
$05Ax	has got something to do with collision, too

$048E time until power-up 1 disappears ($043E +)
